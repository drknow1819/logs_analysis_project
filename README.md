# Project 1: _**Logs Analysis**_

Logs analysis program is a simple [**python**](https://www.python.org/shell) code using the `psycopg2` module to connect to the database. It works as a reporting tool which use information from a newspaper's database to retrieve many things such as _"what kind of articles the readers like"_, and **much more**.

### Techniques
